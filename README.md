# Array Manipulation and Reversion

This Python script performs a sequence of operations on a list of numbers based on the Fibonacci sequence. It also contains functionality to reverse the operations and retrieve the original list.

## Description

The script is broken down into the following operations:

1. **Array Creation**: A list is created containing a sequence of numbers from the Fibonacci sequence.

2. **Array Manipulation**: Two additional lists are created. The first one takes each number from the original list, subtracts a counter (which increases with each iteration), and then adds the current milliseconds. The second list takes each result from the first list, subtracts the original number, and multiplies it by the log of an incrementing counter.

3. **Array Reversion**: The script then reverses the operations to retrieve the original list.

## Usage

The script can be run from the command line using the following command:
`python3 arraysCommunication.py`
